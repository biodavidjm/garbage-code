			<p> Dictyostelium cells are relatively easy to grow: they proliferate either in association with bacteria on a solid substratumor in a rich liquid medium. Because Dictyostelium is a free-living unicellular organism, there is no need to control nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The cells can be grown in a standard microbiology incubator or on the laboratory bench provided that the room temperature is kept constant at approximately 22Â°C. Development is induced by starvation and proceeds under the same conditions. This paper describes cell culturing and development procedures for Dictyostelium and provides many useful tips formanipulating this organism.</p>

			<p>When grown on bacteria, Dictyostelium cells have a doubling time of approximately 4 h. However, in the laboratory, it is often desirable to grow Dictyostelium cells as a pure culture in the absence of bacteria, known as axenic growth. Wild-type strains are unable to grow in axenic conditions. Derivatives of the wild-type strain NC-4 that can grow free of other living organisms (axenic or AX strains) have been obtained (1,2). Cells grown in axenic medium have slower growth rates with a doubling time of roughly 8-12 h depending on temperature, medium and the presence of selective drugs (3). Growth can also vary significantly between different cell lines. Axenic strains can easily be transferred from bacterial growth conditions to axenic culture.</p>
